How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

     It shows exactly which lines you should be looking for

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

     It enables me to see which changes I did, and allows me to undo a change that I should not
     have made

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros of manually choosing: some of the changes that I did to the file may still need some 
   more work to be ready, and I don't want them to be uploaded yet
   You can send them in bulks of interrelated changes, all at once, and if you need to undo them, 
   they are undone all at once

   Pros of automatic saving: you dont forget to update
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Some changes done to files must be accompanied by changes to other files (eg.:
    adding a function prototipe to one file and a function definition to another).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    	Git log lets you see all the commits and git diff lets you view all the changes from one commit to
        the other

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control allows you to go back in time before a bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
